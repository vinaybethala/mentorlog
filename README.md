# MentorLog

MentorLog is a tutor–student management platform designed to track attendance,
subjects taught, session timings, and student progress in a structured way.

## Problem Statement
Tutors and academies struggle to track:
- Tutor availability and leave days
- Which student attended which session
- Subjects covered and time spent
- Weekly progress and exam preparation

Most tracking is manual, error-prone, and inefficient.

## Solution
MentorLog provides a centralized system where:
- Tutors log sessions with time, subject, and student details
- Students can view their progress and plans
- Admins get a clear daily and weekly overview

## Key Features (Planned)
- Tutor & Student authentication
- Session logging (time, subject, student)
- Weekly progress tracking
- Homework & next plan updates
- Admin dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Database: SQLite (initial), PostgreSQL (later)
- Tools: Git, GitHub
